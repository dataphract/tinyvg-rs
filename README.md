# tinyvg-rs

A TinyVG vector graphics format parsing library.

## Testing

This library uses the example files from the [TinyVG/examples] repo for
integration testing.  That repository is included as a submodule in the
[example-files][example-files] directory.  If you cloned this repository using a
simple `git clone`, the example files will be missing.  You can use `git
submodule update --init` from the root of the cloned repository to pull the
submodule.
